# Coding Challenges

This repository contains solutions to two coding challenges: Array Manipulation and String Transformation. Each challenge includes a JavaScript implementation, along with explanations and examples.

## Challenge 1: Array Manipulation

### Problem Statement

Given an array of integers and a target sum, determine if there exists a contiguous subarray within the array that sums up to the target. Return true if such a subarray exists, otherwise return false.

### Example

- Input: `arr = [4, 2, 7, 1, 9, 5]`, `target = 17`

-hasSubarrayWithSum(arr, target)

- Output: `true`

# Challenge 2: String Transformation Challenge

## Problem Statement

Given a string, transform it based on the following rules:
- If the length of the string is divisible by 3, reverse the entire string.
- If the length of the string is divisible by 5, replace each character with its ASCII code.
- If the length of the string is divisible by both 3 and 5 (i.e., divisible by 15), perform both operations in the order specified above.

### Examples

1. Input: `"Hamburger"`
   - Output: `"regrubmaH"`

2. Input: `"Pizza"`
   - Output: `"80 105 122 122 97"`

3. Input: `"Chocolate Chip Cookie"`
   - Output: `"eikooCpihCetalocohC"
